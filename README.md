# TypeScript Hangman Game with React

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game, built with TypeScript and the React framework. The goal was to learn and experiment with React fundamentals and TypeScript's type safety within a familiar context.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay:** Guess the hidden word by selecting letters.
- **TypeScript:** Leverages TypeScript for enhanced type safety, code readability, and developer experience.
- **React:** Utilizes React to structure the game as components, manage game state, and handle user interactions.
- **Minimalist UI:** Focuses on core gameplay elements with a clean and straightforward interface.

## Purpose

This project served as a practical learning experience, allowing for:

- **React Exploration:** Hands-on practice with React components, state management (e.g., `useState`), and event handling.
- **TypeScript Integration:** Understanding how TypeScript enhances React development through static typing and improved tooling.
- **Learning by Doing:** Reinforcing fundamental concepts through a fun and interactive project.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<>/hangman.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd hangman
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the Server**

  ```bash
   npm start
  ```
## Project Status

This project is complete as a learning exercise. There are currently no planned updates or feature additions.

## Potential Enhancements

- **Word Categories:** Introduce word categories (e.g., animals, countries) to diversify gameplay.
- **Difficulty Levels:** Implement difficulty settings with varying numbers of allowed guesses.
- **Visual Feedback:** Enhance the UI with animations or visual cues for correct/incorrect guesses.
- **Multiplayer Mode:** Allow players to challenge each other in a multiplayer version.
