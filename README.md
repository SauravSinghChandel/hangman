# TypeScript Hangman Game with React

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game, built with TypeScript and the React framework. The goal was to learn and experiment with React fundamentals and TypeScript's type safety within a familiar context.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay:** Guess the hidden word by selecting letters.
- **TypeScript:** Leverages TypeScript for enhanced type safety, code readability, and developer experience.
- **React:** Utilizes React to structure the game as components, manage game state, and handle user interactions.
- **Minimalist UI:** Focuses on core gameplay elements with a clean and straightforward interface.

## Purpose

This project served as a practical learning experience, allowing for:

- **React Exploration:** Hands-on practice with React components, state management (e.g., `useState`), and event handling.
- **TypeScript Integration:** Understanding how TypeScript enhances React development through static typing and improved tooling.
- **Learning by Doing:** Reinforcing fundamental concepts through a fun and interactive project.
